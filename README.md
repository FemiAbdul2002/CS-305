CS-305-H7010 Software Security
As the lead developer for the Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment, I engaged in a thorough examination of the software application to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

Artemis Financial, our client, sought assistance in bolstering the security of their application. Through our assessment, I discovered several key areas that needed attention.

During the initial phase of interpreting client needs, it became evident that explicit security requirements were lacking. This insight highlighted the necessity for the client to provide clearer security guidelines to enable the integration of appropriate measures.

Our assessment covered various facets of security:

Architecture Review: This phase unearthed potential vulnerabilities from Input Validation to Code Quality. Addressing these weaknesses would necessitate a more comprehensive architecture review.
Manual Review: This involved an in-depth analysis across views, models, controllers, data access patterns, services, plug-ins, and APIs. We identified vulnerabilities in each of these components.
Static Testing: Through static testing, we uncovered areas in error handling and code quality that required improvement.
To mitigate these vulnerabilities effectively, I formulated a plan:

Requesting explicit security requirements from the client.
Conducting a detailed architecture review.
Implementing improvements in error handling and code quality.
Addressing vulnerabilities identified in the manual review.
Enhancing static testing processes to rectify code vulnerabilities.
Ensuring both functionality and security post-refactoring involved a rigorous testing regime encompassing regression testing, penetration testing, and fuzz testing. This comprehensive approach aimed to eliminate any newly introduced vulnerabilities.

For future assignments, I plan to incorporate a blend of automated tools for static and dynamic analysis, alongside manual code review, to enhance the depth and accuracy of assessments. I'll prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation when deciding on mitigation techniques.
